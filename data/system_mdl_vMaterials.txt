# Define the raytracer's rendering strategy
# This setting is only used in rtigo3. nvlink_shared, rtigo9 and rtigo10 use the strategy 3 when there are more then one devices active.
# 0 = Interactive Single-GPU, with or without OpenGL interop.
#     Full frame accumulation in local memory, read to host buffer when needed.
# 1 = Interactive Multi-GPU Zero Copy, no OpenGL interop.
#     Tiled rendering with tileSize blocks in a checkered pattern distributed to all enabled GPUs directly to pinned memory on the host.
#     Works with any number of enabled devices.
# 2 = Interactive Multi-GPU Peer Access
#     Tiled rendering with tileSize blocks in a checkered pattern evenly distributed to all enabled GPUs.
#     The full image is allocated only on the first device, the peer devices directly render into the shared buffer.
#     This is not going to work with more than one island in the active devices.
# 3 = Interactive Multi-GPU rendering into local GPU buffers of roughly 1/activeDevices size.
#     Tiled rendering with tileSize blocks in a checkered pattern evenly distributed to all enabled GPUs.
#     The full image is composited on the first device resp. the OpenGL interop device.
#     The local data from other devices (not full resolution) is copied to that main device and composited by a native CUDA kernel.

# strategy 3

# The devicesMask indicates which devices should be used in a 32-bit bitfield.
# The default is 255 which means 8 bits set so all boards in an RTX server.
# The application will only use the boards actually visible.
# This uses the first visble GPU device only:

# Use different strategies to update the OpenGL display texture.
# If the system configuration is not running an NVIDIA OpenGL implementation, set this to 0.
# The performance effect of interop 2 is only really visible for interactive rendering (-m 0) and present 1.
# 0 = Use host buffers to transfer the result into the OpenGL display texture (slowest).
# 1 = Register the texture image with CUDA and copy into the array directly (fewest copies).
# 2 = Register the pixel buffer for direct rendering in single GPU or as staging buffer in multi-GPU (needs more memory than interop 1).
#     Not available with multi-GPU zero copy strategy because the buffer resides in host memory then.
#     For multi-GPU peer access the renderer cannot directly render with peer-to-peer into the OpenGL PBO and needs a separate shared buffer for rendering.
# Benchmarking is faster with interop off!

interop 1

# Controls if every rendered image or final tile should be displayed (1) or only once per second (0) to save PCI-E bandwidth.
# Can be toggled inside the GUI.
# 0 = present only once per second (except for the first half second which accumulates)
# 1 = present every rendered image

present 0

# Controls resource sharing across devices via CUDA peer-to-peer access when possible.
# Bit 0 = Allow sharing via PCI-E bus. Only share across NVLINK bridges when off (default off)
# Bit 1 = Allow sharing of texture CUarray or CUmipmappedArray data (legacy and MDL) (fast) (default on)
# Bit 2 = Allow sharing of geometry acceleration structures and vertex attributes (slowest) (default off)
# Bit 3 = Allow sharing of spherical environment light texture and CDFs (slow) (default off)
# Bit 4 = Allow sharing of MDL Measured BSDF and their CDFs (slow) (default off)
# Bit 5 = Allow sharing of MDL Lightprofiles and their CDFs (slow) (default off)

# Rendering resolution is independent of the window client size.

# Scene dependent epsilon factor scaled by 1.0e-7.
