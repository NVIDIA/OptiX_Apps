@REM The rtigo9 and rtigo10 examples use an enhanced scene description where camera and tone mapper values can be 
@REM overridden and materials for surfaces and lights and all light types themselves can be defined per scene now.
@REM For that the material definition has changed slightly to support surface and emission distribution functions and some more parameters.
@REM Read the provided scene_rtigo9_demo.txt file for how to define all supported light types.
.\rtigo9 -s system_rtigo9_demo.txt -d scene_rtigo9_demo.txt

@REM That scene_rtigo9_demo.txt is not using cutout opacity or surface materials on arbitrary mesh lights,
@REM which means using it with rtigo10 will result in the same image, it will just run considerably faster.

.\rtigo10 -s system_rtigo9_demo.txt -d scene_rtigo9_demo.txt

@REM The rtigo9_omm example uses Opacity Micromaps (OMM) which are built using the OptiX Toolkit CUDA OMM Baking tool (CuOmmBaking.dll).
@REM The following command loads a generated OBJ file with 15,000 unit quads randomly placed and oriented inside 
@REM a sphere with radius 20 units. (Generator code is in createQuads()).
@REM The material assigned to the quads is texture mapped with a leaf texture for albedo and cutout opacity.
@REM The same command line can be used with rtigo9 to see the performance difference esp. on Ada generation GPUs
@REM which accelerate OMMs in hardware. (Try higher rendering resolutions than the default 1024x1024.)

.\rtigo9_omm -s system_rtigo9_leaf.txt -d scene_rtigo9_leaf.txt


@REM The rtigo12 example uses a slightly enhanced scene description format than rtigo9 and rtigo10 in that 
@REM it added material parameters for the volume scattering color, scale and bias.
@REM Above command lines for rtigo10 work as well, though mesh and rectangle lights will be 1/PI darker due
@REM to a change from radiant intensity to radiant exitance definition with diffuse EDFs.
@REM The following scene files demonstrate all BXDF implementations and the volume scattering parameters
@REM and shows that volumetric shadows just work when placing lights and objects into surrounding objects with volume scattering.

@REM The MDL_renderer example uses the NVIDIA Material definition language for the shader generation. 
@REM The following scene only uses the *.mdl files and resources from the data/mdl folder you copied next 
@REM to the executable after building the examples. These show most of the fundamental MDL BSDFs, EDFs, 
@REM VDFs, layers, mixers, modifiers, thin-walled geometry, textures, cutout opacity, base helper functions, etc.
