// Prevent that division by very small floating point values results in huge values, for example dividing by pdf.
#define DENOMINATOR_EPSILON 1.0e-6f

// 0 == All debug features disabled. Code optimization level on maximum. (Benchmark only in this mode!)
// 1 == All debug features enabled. Code generated with full debug info. (Really only for debugging, big performance hit!)

// 1 == Enable clock() usage and time view display.
#define USE_TIME_VIEW 0

// The m_clockFactor GUI value is scaled by this. 
// With a default of m_clockFactor = 1000 this means a million clocks will be value 1.0 in the alpha channel
// which is used as 1D texture coordinate inside the GLSL display shader and results in white in the temperature ramp texture.
#define CLOCK_FACTOR_SCALE 1.0e-9f

// The number of supported texture coordinate slots inside MDL shaders (state::texture_*(i)).
// This makes the Mdl_state bigger which will cost performance!
// hair_bsdf() requires two texture coordinates to communicate the intersection results
// and a per fiber texture coordinate which can be used to color each hair individually. 
// That's the whole reason for this define.
// HACK The renderer's vertex attributes are not actually managing two distinct texture coordinates.
// The Mdl_state will simply duplicate the data of texture coordinate slot 0 to slot 1 everywhere except for the hair_bsdf().
#define NUM_TEXTURE_SPACES 2

// The number of float4 elements inside the texture_results cache. Default is 16.
// Used to configure the MDL backend's code generation with set_option("num_texture_results", ...)
// This value influences how many things can be precalculated inside the init() function.
// If the number of result elements in this array is lower than what is required,
// the expressions for the remaining results will be compiled into the sample() and evaluate() functions
// which will make the compilation and runtime performance slower. 
// For very resource-heavy materials, experiment with bigger values.
#define NUM_TEXTURE_RESULTS 16

// Switch the MDL-SDK image plugin between OpenImageIo and FreeImage.
// The open-source MDL-SDK 2023 (367100.2992) release on github.com switched to the OpenImageIO plugin by default
