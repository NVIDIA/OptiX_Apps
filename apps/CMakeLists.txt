add_subdirectory( rtigo3 )

# Multi-GPU NVLINK texture and geometry acceleration structure peer-to-peer sharing example.
# Rendering is derived from the rtigo3 multi-GPU strategy RS_INTERACTIVE_MULTI_GPU_LOCAL_COPY.

add_subdirectory( nvlink_shared )

# Similar to nvlink_shared, but showing how to implement more light types.
# Implements singular point lights, spot lights, and IES light profiles (all with and without additional colored projection texture),
# rectangle area lights with or without importance sampled emission texture and support for cutout opacity,
# arbitrary triangle mesh area lights with and without emission texture and support for cutout opacity,
# constant and importance sampled spherical HDR environment lights.
# All lights can be placed and oriented with transform matrices and the spherical HDR environment can be freely oriented with a rotation matrix.
# The scene description file format has been overhauled to allow overrides of the camera and tonemapper settings,
# definition of emissive materials and lights, and surface materials and geometry (as before).
# Both rtigo9 and rtigo10 allow toggling the direct lighting at runtime which is usful when testing direct lighting implementations.
# Singular lights won't have any effect without direct lighting because they cannot be hit implicitly
# because they don't exist as geometry inside the scene. (Infinitely small lights do not exist in the physical world.)
add_subdirectory( rtigo9 )

# Same as rtigo9 but using Opacity Micromaps (OMM) for cutout textures which require OptiX SDK 7.6.0 or higher.
# OMMs are hardware accelerated on RTX Ada generation GPUs.
# The OMM generation is done with the OptiX Toolkit CUDA OmmBaking tool.
# The main renderer differences are the use of the OMMs for materials with cutout opacity.
# That required a change of the GAS instancing since not all GAS can be used with all materials anymore.
# Additionally the shadow/visibility ray implementation must use a different, faster implementation because
# fully transparent or fully opaque micro triangle intersections on cutout opacity materials do not invoke 
# the anyhit program anymore, which is the main purpose and performance benefit of OMMs.

# Similar to rtigo9, but showing the maximum performance implementation with the smallest possible Shader Binding Table
# with one hit record entry per material shader and no hit records for the shadow ray!
# For that all BxDF sampling and evaluation callable programs have been replaced with individual closesthit programs.
# The cutoutout opacity feature has been removed to be able to use the fastest possible implementation for the shadow/visibility ray type.
# That can then be implemented without anyhit program by just using a miss shader instead.
# It's using the same scene description as rtigo9, but cutoput opacity textures are ignored.
add_subdirectory( rtigo10 )

# Based on rtigo10 but changed integrator to work like the MDL_renderer for throughput, pdf, and lights.
# Note that mesh and rect lights are now defined with radiant exitance instead of radiant intensity,
# so with the diffuse EDF these are 1/PI darker than in rtigo10 but match the MDL_renderer.
# Replaced the GGX-Smith implementation with excerpts from the MDL SDK libbsdf to support direct lighting of glossy transparent materials.
# That means singular light types will now show proper reflections on glossy transparent objects 
# and even caustics when the roughness is not too smooth, because hitting backfaces will be directly lit from lights
# on the transmission side which adds radiance.
# Added support for Specular and GGX_Smith BTDF materials.
# Also homogeneous volume scattering is implemented in this example the same way as inside the MDL_renderer. (See scene_rtigo12_*.txt files for examples.)
add_subdirectory( rtigo12 )

# Based on rtigo9, but replacing all material handling with MDL materials.
# The MDL SDK is used to generate the minimal amount of direct callable programs per MDL material shader.
# The closesthit and anyhit programs inside hit.cu call the valid direct callable programs to handle the input values
# from MDL expressions and the sampling and evaluation of the material's distribution functions.
